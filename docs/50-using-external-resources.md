There soon comes the point where you'd like to include "external" resources such as:

- Style sheets (.css files)
- JavaScript libraries (.js files)
- Fonts
- and other resources

The Custom Component API doesn't differ from the Visualization Extension API, therefore loading external resources works exactly the same.
